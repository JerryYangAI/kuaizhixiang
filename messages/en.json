          "q1": {
            "question": "How do I choose a box based on specifications like \"Size 60, 80, 100\"?",
            "answer": "Japanese courier companies like Takkyubin use a standard size numbering system. Numbers like 60, 80, 100, 120 represent different size specifications. Each number corresponds to a specific length × width × height range.\n\nOn 快纸箱 product pages, we clearly label \"Suitable for Takkyubin XX size\" and display detailed length × width × height (in centimeters). You can choose the appropriate size based on the longest side and total volume of items you need to pack. If unsure, we recommend choosing a slightly larger size and leaving space for cushioning materials (like bubble wrap)."
          },
          "q2": {
            "question": "If I'm not sure about the size, how should I choose to be safe?",
            "answer": "We recommend following these steps:\n\n1. First, measure the longest, widest, and highest dimensions of items you need to pack (in centimeters)\n2. Add 2-5 centimeters to each side as buffer space based on the measurements\n3. Choose a slightly larger box based on the adjusted size\n4. If items are heavy or fragile, we recommend choosing a thicker box (check the thickness label on the product page)\n\nIf you're still unsure, you can contact our customer service, provide the item dimensions and weight, and we'll recommend a suitable box for you."
          },
          "q3": {
            "question": "What is the weight capacity of boxes? Can they hold books, clothes, or appliances?",
            "answer": "Each product page displays the recommended weight capacity range (in kilograms). Generally:\n\n• Size 60 boxes: Suitable for 10-15 books, small electronics, lightweight clothing\n• Size 80 boxes: Suitable for 20-30 books, medium-weight items, clothing\n• Size 100 boxes: Suitable for 40-50 books, small appliances, heavier items\n• Size 120 boxes: Suitable for large items, furniture parts, etc.\n\nPlease note:\n- Heavy items like books should be distributed evenly, avoid concentrating them in one place\n- Fragile items (like appliances) require additional cushioning materials\n- If items are close to the weight limit, we recommend choosing a thicker box or using multiple boxes"
